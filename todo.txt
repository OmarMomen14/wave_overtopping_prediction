Sun 26.02
- Did quick exploration.

Sun 12.03
- Do normalization to all the input variables.
- Do log tenth scale transformation to the target variable q

Future tasks:
- Do training-test split
- Do training with xgboost
- Feature selection/enginerring
- bootstrap resampling
- prediction errors (look at paper of prediction)

# Datasets:
1. v01: raw data (no splits)
2. v02: standard scaled input data (no splits)
3. v03: standard scaled input data + log scaled q (no splits)
