- Did quick exploration.

Sun 12.03
- Do normalization to all the input variables.
- Do log tenth scale transformation to the target variable q

- Plot graphs before scale and after scale to show scaling reduced outlliers and standrized the scale across the features
    -- turned out scaling don't remove outliers at all, it just rescale the feature values, which is useful for the model training
    -- graphs show only the rescaling thing
- Plot a graph of (maybe box plot) to show range of q
- Graph for q before applying the log scale to show the skewed data distribution
- Get RMSE of train_data DONE
- Re-grid search with new lr values
- Plot graphs of q_pred vs q_actual
- Bias error and R_sq

- Look at bootstrap resampling


Future tasks:
- grid search of hyperparams --> Done
- Feature selection/enginerring (to reduce the used parameters, eliminate the weak predictors)
- bootstrap resampling 

# Datasets:
1. v01: raw data (no splits)
2. v02: standard scaled input data (no splits)
3. v03: standard scaled input data + log scaled q (no splits)

# Models
- model_28_05_mape504 (trained on v03 dataset)
- scaler_databasev_02.pkl (scale all the features)
